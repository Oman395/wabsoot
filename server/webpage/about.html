                    Hi! My name is Oran, I'm a 15 year old from new york city currently going to HSMSE in sophomore year. This website is mostly a challenge to myself, as I don't often do web design so it's a refreshing break. I specialize mostly in node.js, but I can do
                    c/pp to a decent degree of success. This site is operating off a custom node.js server, currently hosted through my PC, so don't expect 24/7 operation.

                    I do a lot of coding (some would say too much) in my free time, as well as a lot of gaming. In node.js, I am best at manipulating files and working with complicated web design, and I am getting better at web design. I can also do electron fairly well,
                    which means I can make desktop apps to a fairly decent degree.

                    To start with, obviously I have made this website. I've also made a discord bot, a server system for serving this website's content, several automation scripts for my schoolwork, and a lot more-- take a look at my github in the top right to see more.
                    I've made a script for the game 'Space engineers', which can take the XML data for a blueprint of a ship, and calculate resource costs by going into the game's files to get resource costs of parts.

                    My life's goal is to do aerospace engineering as a career, but to start with I'm going to try and get an undergrad in some engineering field at a decent college, then try to get a master's/doctorate at somewhere like caltech or mit. I'm currently on the
                    board of my school's aerospace club, where I'm leading our rocketry program. If you are from HSMSE, find out more from me, Arpad, Ming (to an extent), or William.
